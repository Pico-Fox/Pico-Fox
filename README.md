# :fox_face: I am PicoFox :fox_face:

I started software developement as a hobby in 2016 and am currently an apprentice.

## Languages I speak

I speak German and English. I can read Cyrillic, but am not able to translate most Russian words.

## Langauges I use for my projects

- SQL (it is everywhere)
- Web-Dev (+ server)
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JS
  - PHP
- Applications / mods / plugins / datapacks
  - Java
  - C#
  - MC-Functions
- At work:
  - VB
  - ABAP

Note: I am most comfortable with Java and HTML/CSS/JS/PHP. The other languages I listed are languages I rarely use.

## Projects

### Vokabelspaß

For a school project, I collaborated with my colleagues on an online 
learning game called [Vokabelspaß](https://github.com/Zeprus/Vokabelspass).
I will start working on a similar project soon.

### Pico's Mosca Mod

I recently started developing a Terraria mod using tModLoader 1.3. It's goal is to 
create morphable and scalable items. Those items can change between classes 
(Sword -> Bow, Sword -> Staff, Staff -> Bow, and so on) and you will be able to
level them up to carry it from the beginning of Terraria all the way to the end.
I am pretty new to tModLoader and C# in general, so it might take some time to
finish.

### PHP-API

For my personal, local server I have created an PHP-API. With it I want to realize
simple database access to all languages and systems without having to import
numerous MySQL libraries or to use the server for advanced calculations across
systems. This API is not supposed to be able to communicate with the internet and
is only for local use - therefore security has not been an issue with my API.
